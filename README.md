# **TASK #1**

## **What is this project?**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a small web application focused mostly on design, a personal decision, as I wanted to explore a bit more of CSS effects and design integration. It may not be perfect, but I'm happy with the current result. Functionally speaking, it is nothing but a small store with a timer that restricts user input and access to the information.
